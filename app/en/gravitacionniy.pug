                                li Gas-condensate mixture is supplied into the gravity separator EG where liquid drops enlarge due to abrupt expansion and speed loss and liquid is separated from the natural gas due to gravity force; also, partial degassing of separated hydrocarbon liquid takes place here. At Customer’s request gravity separator may be designed as a separator with an option of liquid phase separation into water and hydrocarbon liquid (for this purpose storage part is designed in separator) and as a separator without a liquid phase separation option. Along the full length of the vessel are installed vertical sections of the separation nozzles (pos.1) allowing to even gas flow speeds across the vessel full section and to stimulate the process of dripping liquid separation from the gas phase. Structural design of vertical sections (separation grates or angle packing) as well as their quantity may vary depending on the process requirements.
                                li Horizontal sections of the separation grates (pos.2) are designed on the interfaces inside the gravity separators EG manufactured by LLC S&PA «NefteGazApparat» in order to prevent wave generation, liquid phases intermixing and carryover of liquid separated from the liquid surface.
                                li Screen knockout drums (pos. 3) are installed perpendicular to the gas flow ahead of the separator outlet in order to increase efficiency of separation process. Gas outlet nozzle is bent opposite to the gas flow direction which allows reducing the volume of dripping liquid carryover with the gas flow. At Customer’s request gravity separator may be equipped with inner heating devices and heat insulation. Blocks of the shutoff and control valves and the separator EG tank are equipped with a drain outlet; vessel also includes nozzles for steaming. Equipment manufactured by LLC S&PA «NefteGazApparat» is supplied in a modular configuration installed on an area with corresponding shipping railway clearances; equipment includes full set of shutoff and control valves, instrumentation and automation.
